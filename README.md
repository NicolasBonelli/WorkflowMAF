# 🧠 Mini Project — Workflow with Microsoft Agent Framework (Python)

## 📘 Description

This project demonstrates the practical use of the **Microsoft Agent Framework** in **Python**, building an **intelligent workflow** that combines conditional logic (branching / switch) and a sequential chain of agents.  
The goal is to showcase how to orchestrate multiple agents that collaborate to handle different types of user requests, simulating a simple corporate environment (e.g., IT Support or Human Resources).
